Scenario
As a new StackFull Software employee, you've been tasked to work alongside Damen, the IT Security Manager, to write a runbook for the IT Pre-onboarding process.

IT onboarding introduces and trains new hires in the technology they'll use in their day-to-day responsibilities. Before onboarding begins, however, the IT team needs to set up and ensure new hire technology is ready for their first day.
A runbook is a detailed "how-to" guide for completing a commonly repeated task or procedure within a company's IT operations process, like setting up a laptop for a new hire.
You have the unique experience of participating in IT onboarding and knowledge of Windows management that can help with this task! Complete each of the steps below using the server and DESKTOP-2 in your Unit 5: Windows VM, then write a runbook to complete the steps for all new hires moving forward.
